# SITA-Wordpress-Publisher

This is my code from 2014. I had a contract with SITA (National Slovak Press Agency) and paid for the agency news. I experimented with parsing and processing their texts. This PHP script was regularly republishing the articles as Wordpress posts with XML-RPC pulling it from the agency's XML and parsing it to a usable format. If needed, it could also automatically translate the articles into Czech with Google Translate API. It worked fairly reliably because it could pick up where it left off, but with time, XML-RPC proved to be a security weak spot, as is clear nowadays.
